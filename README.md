- 👋 Hi, I’m @Joannacccch
- 👀 I’m interested in Digital Cultural Heritage programs in the GLAM sector(galleries, libraries, archives and museums). A very new beginner in scripting and programming. I find this programming language very interesting and unique. I want to know more with the help of the experts here!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Digital Humanities postgraduate program at Univerisity College London.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the Digital Cultural Heritage programs in tech companies, cultural third parties and the GLAM sector.
